# Weather App

### Developed with React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

### Scope of improvement

- Service worker can be used to cache images and fonts and It can lead to better performance.
- We can use geolocation navigator api to get user's location and give weather details based on that.
